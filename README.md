# Twine Project
A few year ago, I decided to create a text-based game using Twinery.org. Twine is a simple tool that is easy to learn and use. It gives you a ability to create no code text stories. However, you can extend your story using variables, conditional logic, images, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To create my game story, I took inspiration from the Eagle's song **"Hotel California"**. It provides the perfect scenario and storyline. In this repository you'll find the HTML code for my game **Trapped in Hotel California**

**HOW TO USE MY CODE FILE**
1. Download my HTML code from this repo
2. Go to http://twinery.org and choose either "use online" or follow instructions to download to your computer (up to you). 
3. Once in the editor select "Import from file"
