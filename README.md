# Twine Project
A few year ago, I decided to create a text-based game using Twinery.org. Twine is a simple tool that is easy to learn and use. It gives you a ability to create no code text stories. However, you can extend your story using variables, conditional logic, images, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To create my game story, I took inspiration from the Eagle's song **"Hotel California"**. It provides the perfect scenario and storyline. In this repository you'll find the HTML code for my game **Trapped in Hotel California**

**HOW TO USE MY CODE FILE**
1. Download my HTML code from this repo, [click here ](https://github.com/myramade/Twinery/blob/main/Trapped%20in%20Hotel%20California2021.html), select the "Copy raw contents" icon next to the pencil. Paste the copied content into a text file and save the file with a the name hotelcalifornia.html
3. Go to http://twinery.org and choose either "use online" or follow instructions to download to your computer (up to you). 
4. Once in the editor select "Import from file" and upload the file you created in step 1
The game file will open in Twine and you can view and edit each of the steps and branching in the game. 

I kept the game simple, using basic markdown for Twine. You can fancy it up but be sure to provide credit to the original game.
